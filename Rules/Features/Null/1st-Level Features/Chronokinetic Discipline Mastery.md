#### Chronokinetic Discipline Mastery

As you advance in your chosen null tradition, you gain certain benefits in combat, including benefits based on the amount of discipline you have. Benefits based on how much discipline you have last until the end of your turn, even if a benefit would become unavailable to you because of the amount of discipline you spend during your turn.

Some Discipline Mastery benefits can be applied only if you are a specific level or higher, with the level of those benefits noted in the tables below.

##### Chronokinetic Mastery

Whenever you use the Inertial Shield ability, you can use the Disengage move action as a free triggered action.

Additionally, as your discipline grows, your psionic mastery of your body intensifies, granting benefits from the Chronokinetic Mastery table. Benefits are cumulative except where an improved benefit replaces a lesser benefit.
