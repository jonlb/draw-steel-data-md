#### Growing Ferocity

You gain certain benefits in combat based on the amount of ferocity you have (see 1st-Level Aspect Features for details). These benefits last until the end of your turn, even if a benefit would become unavailable to you because of the amount of ferocity you spend during your turn.

Some Growing Ferocity benefits can be applied only if you are a specific level or higher, with the level of those benefits noted in the various Growing Ferocity tables in this section.
