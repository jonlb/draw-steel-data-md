    "description": "The native ancestry of the Seven Cities of Hell, devils are humanoids with red or blue skin expressed in a wide variety of hues, from bright crimson to deep purple. Each devil is born with some *hellmark*-horns, a tail, cloven hooves, a forked tongue, fanged incisors, or even wings.\n\nHell is dominated by the Seven Cities of Hell, each ruled by a different archdevil who constantly plots and schemes against the others in the hope of ascending to the Throne of Hell.\n\nThose devils who join \"the trade,\" as their civil service is called, spend their days in bureaucratic service hoping or scheming for promotion. Devils looking for a quick path up the bureaucratic ladder sign up for the Exchange, whereby mortals in the mundane world who perform the right rituals can summon a devil, who bargains with the supplicant on behalf of their archdevil. Archdevils can grant temporary worldly power in exchange for a supplicant's soul, with the summoned devil acting as the broker.\n\nOn rare occasions, though, the summoning goes wrong and the supplicant dies before the deal can be struck, stranding the summoned devil on Orden permanently. Some stranded devils seek to return to Hell, but most prefer life in Orden, where the phrase \"stabbed in the back by a colleague\" is usually a metaphor.\n\nThe majority of devils in Orden are not from, nor have ever been to, the Seven Cities. They are descendants of devils who were stranded in the mundane world decades, centuries, even millennia ago.",
    "lore": "Adelard scuttled across the floor of his basement, a heavy tome clutched in one hand, his index finger marking a page. Occasionally he would stop, open the book, consult a diagram, look at the chalk markings he'd made on the floor, tilt his head, then bend down and refine or rub out an esoteric symbol.\n\nOne of the red candles suddenly guttered out, making the small room noticeably darker. \"Damn and blast!\" he hissed. Then he relit it from another candle.\n\nStepping back to admire his handiwork, Adelard crossed his arms and nodded. He'd spent his last coppers on the candles—they weren't cheap. And he feared the skull might be fake, but did it matter? The book just said *a* skull—it didn't even specify a *human* skull! Did it matter if it was real? It was probably real. What kind of market was there for replica skulls? But it was awfully cheap. Anyway, did it matter? How would the ritual *know* if the skull was real?\n\nHe was wittering, putting off the inevitable. He pulled himself together. It was either going to work, or it wasn't, and wittering wasn't going to help. He opened the book and turned the page—then began to speak the ritual.\n\nMoments later, the candles flared, there was a burst of flame, and acrid brimstone filled his nostrils. When the smoke cleared... there was a devil standing in his basement—dark purple skin, horns, even a twitching tail.\n\n\"Aha! Yes, finally.\" The creature rubbed his hands together. \"It's about time,\" he said, pulling on the bottom of his waistcoat to straighten it. \"Now then! How does it go? Oh, yes.\" He cleared his throat. \"On behalf of my lord, his grace Archduke Dispater, Lord of Dis, I am empowered to offer you...\" But his speech fell on deaf ears.\n\n\"It worked!\" Adelard said, holding his clenched fists up. \"Ahahaha! It worked! Finally, after *years*! I will have my revenge! Hahaha...! \\*cough\\* \\*cough\\*\" Adelard was suddenly gripped by a coughing fit, but he kept crowing.\n\n\"Dismiss me from service, will they?! \\*cough\\* Old and useless... am I?! I'll show *them*!\" He coughed again, fighting to breathe now. \"I will *hex* them and *torture* them until they...\"\n\nHe stopped cavorting and capering, and his eyes went wide. \"Until they... until...\" He clutched his chest.\n\n\"Uh-oh,\" the devil said, genuinely worried.\n\n\"HNNG!\" Adelard grunted. Then he collapsed to the ground, curled into a fetal position, obviously in immense pain.\n\n\"Nono. Nurse!\" the devil called out. \"Doctor?! Is anyone... you should lie down. Well, you are lying down. Do some... some deep-breathing exercises. Have a cup of tea! That always...\"\n\nAdelard gasped one last time and uncurled, muscles relaxed. Eyes open but unseeing.\n\n\"... calms me down,\" the devil said quietly.\n\nSuddenly, the candles were extinguished as one, plunging the room into pitch blackness. The devil's hellsight meant this was only a minor inconvenience for him. \"Um,\" he said to the empty room. \"Uh-oh.\"\n\nHe poked the tip of his boot at the chalk symbol surrounding him on the floor. Nothing happened. He stepped on it. Nothing happened. He put his weight on that foot. No alarms went off.\n\nHe walked out of the circle. Nothing happened. No one, it seemed, cared.\n\nA few moments later, the door to a small home, little more than a wooden shack, on the outskirts of a small village opened. A well-dressed devil peeked out and then slowly emerged, stepping onto the dirt road that led through the center of the village. A keep stood atop a hill in the distance.\n\n\"Ah,\" the devil said.\n\nA wide woman dressed in wool, carrying a pile of clean clothes, saw him and stopped in her tracks, her mouth open.\n\n\"Oh! Good day to you, madam. I wonder if you could tell me...\"\n\n\"AAAHHHHH!!!\" she screamed. For quite a long time. Then she dropped her laundry and ran.\n\n\"Ah. Um. Hmm.\"\n\nA young man in a low, stone building saw this exchange, grabbed what looked like a long iron poker, and ran out to confront the new arrival.\n\n\"Have at you, devil!\" he said, assuming something like a dueling pose. \"I say! Steady on!\" The devil raised his hands.\n\nThe two of them stood there, frozen in the middle of the street for a few moments.\n\nThen the devil turned and ran away as quickly as he could.\n\n• \"And that's how I ended up here!\" Riyalkin toasted his dinner companion. \"Now, after years of obscurity, a legendary hero!\"\n\n\"Legendarily *vain*,\" his dinner guest teased with a smile.\n\n\"Simply playing my part, darling. People expect a certain amount of vanity in a troubadour, don't they?\"\n\nShe laughed. \"Riyalkin the Red Pen is every bit as advertised.\"\n\n\"Thank you. And besides, accusations of vanity are a bit rich coming from my leading lady.\"\n\n\"Not all actors are vain.\" She took offense beautifully. \"Just the good ones.\" She sipped her drink.\n\n\"Well then, you must be very vain indeed,\" the devil said. \"Anyway, does that answer your question?\"\n\n\"Mostly. Do they speak Caelian in Hell?\"\n\n\"*What* a good question. Unless it's *very* old, the ritual usually grants knowledge of the summoner's language. I gather in the bad old days, we used to just show up in a cloud of brimstone and gabble at people. I'm sure it was impressive, but what did it achieve? Not very professional, I can tell you that.\"\n\n\"No cloud of brimstone now?\" she teased.\n\nHe waggled his eyebrows. \"Style counts for something.\"\n\n\"But wait, that was...\" She did some quick mental math. \"Fifteen years ago?\"\n\n\"Well, I was an accountant here in Capital for several years in between.\" \"An accountant!\"\n\nRiyalkin shrugged. \"It's what I did before. I'm moderately good at it.\" \"And how does one go from being an alien accountant to a famous troubadour?\"\n\n\"Well...\" Riyalkin seemed uncomfortable suddenly. \"It's just that... the thing is, accountancy in the Seven Cities is just so much more interesting than it is here. Plotting and scheming, always on the lookout for an assassin, people constantly trying to claw their way up the ladder, usually over your dead body. And I guess I just... missed the excitement.\"\n\n\"The excitement of being an accountant.\"\n\n\"The excitement of being an accountant *in Hell*,\" Riyalkin said. \"In any event, enough about me and the thrill of double-entry bookkeeping. Perhaps you can enlighten me. Why is it, in spite of my impeccable taste\n\nand the outrageous sums I spend looking good, I always feel *underdressed* in your presence? Do you employ sorcery? Or is it that any outfit is improved by your *unearthly* beauty?\"\n\nShe blushed in spite of herself and raised her own glass in a toast. \"You silver-tongued devil.\"",

    "description": "The ritual of Dracogenesis that grants the power to create a generation of dragon knights—also known as draconians or wyrmwights—is obscure and supremely difficult for even an experienced sorcerer to master. Small populations of draconians in Khemhara, Higara, and Khoursir attest to this. Descendants of original generations created millennia ago by powerful wizards, they have never been numerous. A typical clutch yields only a single egg. After only a few generations, these draconians begin to show new adaptations like feathers or frilled ridges.\n\nThe largest extant population of draconians is the remnants of the Dragon Phalanx in Vasloria. Created by Good King Omund's wizard Vitae, the Dragon Phalanx once numbered several thousand of the king's greatest knights, ensuring the rule of law across the land.\n\nKnighthood was a title carried by every member of that first generation of dragon knights. Within the Dragon Phalanx were shadows, censors, tacticians, and elementalists. Members of virtually every heroic vocation could be found in one of the eight dragonflights that made up the phalanx. For over 30 years, these heroes were symbols of justice, protecting the weak from the strong, and standing between the common folk and those who sought power over others. Those who grew up in that place and time could not imagine any other way of life.\n\nThen Ajax came.",
    "lore": "The cloaked figure at the back of the inn stood up. As they did so, their hood slipped down, revealing their head and face. A susurration rippled through the crowd. One man standing near the bar dropped his jaw, followed by his flagon of mead.\n\nA tall, broad draconian stepped into the light. He was old, his scales battle-scarred. He rested one clawed hand on the pommel of a mace that hung from a loop on his belt, while the other carried his shield by a strap. His flat, expressionless look was more terrifying than any threatening glower.\n\nThe three human bandits took a step back. One of the dwarves just sneered—then, sensing his human compatriots' reluctance, turned to look at them. \"What's this?\" the lead dwarf growled.\n\nLooking at the dragon knight, another bandit added quickly, \"We didn't know there was one of you here.\"\n\nThe draconian didn't move. Didn't give any indication he heard the man. Just stared unblinking at the lead dwarf. \"Think of the *bounty*,\" the dwarf hissed to the humans, but he kept his eye on the draconian. \"We'll all be *rich*.\"\n\nThe two dwarves surveyed the tavern. The people were now all facing them. A few had stood up. They weren't afraid anymore.\n\n\"We'll be *back*,\" the lead dwarf said, and the group of them backed out of the inn, sheathing their shortswords before they turned and left.\n\nAs one, the people in the tavern turned to look with undisguised awe at the dragon knight. He noticed this, ducked his head to avoid their gaze. \"Show's over,\" he growled, then he turned to go back to his seat in the rear.\n\nA short, doughty, middle-aged man stood up, and two equally doughty women at the same table stood up with him. \"Excuse me, sir knight,\" the man said as the dragon knight walked past their table.\n\nThe knight moved on, ignoring them. The man reached out and grabbed the massive draconian's arm. The knight wheeled on the peasant, looming over him.\n\nThe man touched his forelock. The two women with him curtseyed. \"Begging your pardon, sir, but we been lookin' for you.\"\n\nThe dragon knight sneered and bared a set of sharp teeth. \"*Look for someone else*,\" he growled as he pulled his arm away.\n\nThe man scurried around to stand in front of the draconian, blocking his way. He took off his worn cap and held it over his breast. \"I'm sorry sir, but there ain't no one else. There's this new tax, you see, from the new baron. And a priest says he's of Saint Ajax.\"\n\nThe knight bared his impressive teeth, ready to scare Jago and the other two away—when someone else spoke.\n\n\"You might want to hear 'em out, Vaant,\" said a voice from the table the three peasants had been sitting at.\n\nThe dragon knight turned sharply to look at the man who'd spoken. His back was to the draconian, but the voice gave him away.\n\n\"John?\"\n\nThe man turned to look up.\n\n\"Hi Vaant,\" he said, smiling. He rose from the table. He was middleaged, fit. Black hair hung down to his shoulders. He was armed with many weapons. \"Folks,\" he said, \"this is Vaantikalisax, knight of King Omund in the Thunder Phalanx. He may be the last of the Storm Knights.\"\n\nThe man held out his hand. The dragon knight looked at it for a moment before reaching out slowly to grasp it. \"What are you doing out here?\" he asked.\n\n\"These people need help. I said I'd find it. Heard a rumor someone matching your description was holed up here having a drinking contest with Mr. John Barleycorn.\"\n\nThe draconian sniffed, released John's hand. \"Sure,\" he said. \"But why *me*?\"\n\n\"Thought maybe you'd like to get back in the game.\"\n\n\"The game.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" Sir John smiled. \"The hero game.\"\n\nThe inn had mostly gone back to its business but the three peasants watched intently. Eventually the dragon knight spoke again, his voice low.\n\n\"I owe you a lot, John—but not everything.\"\n\n\"I'm not asking everything.\"\n\n\"No, that's not how it starts. But I have this feeling that's how it'll end.\"\n\n\"What does your oath say? 'Even should the sun stop in the sky, even should the night-'\"\n\n\"John,\" the dragon knight said, his voice suddenly sad. Exasperated. \"You don't want to quote my oath to me. You really don't. I liked serving with you. I have fond memories of that time—of you. Don't spoil it.\" He looked at his friend, the three peasants, then shook his head and turned to leave the inn.\n\n\"Vaant,\" Sir John said, following. \"Sir Vaantikalisax, by your *oath*!\" The dragon knight stopped and spun around. Everyone in the inn was watching the show again. Act two.\n\n\"The people need leadership,\" John said.\n\nVaantikalisax's reptile eyes flashed in anger. \"They *had it*! Thirty years, and what did it amount to?! I watched Ajax... I watched him...\" The dragon knight's eyes flinched. His clawed hands tightened on his mace and shield. \"I watched the oath... fail.\"\n\n\"Vaant... Vaant, the Dragon Phalanx didn't *fail*. You were *betrayed*. It was Mandrake! One of your own, don't you get it? You're just as fallible as the rest of us. You were never 'incorruptible.' It's just what we wanted to believe. You're just people—like the rest of us.\"\n\nThe dragon knight looked at the people around him, at the three peasants desperate for someone, anyone, to help them. Then he looked back to his friend.\n\n\"Exactly,\" Vaantikalisax said. Then he turned and left the inn.",

    "lore": "\"They can be stubborn,\" Embers said.\n\nJohn smiled and gave her a look as they walked around the barn. \"Yeah not like elves and humans, right?\"\n\nEmbers grinned.\n\n\"They're good in a fight,\" John said, and his tone implied this was all that mattered. \"They're natural commanders.\"\n\n\"Yes I can imagine why,\" Embers said. \"Each sentence sounds like an order.\"\n\nThey found the dwarf at the edge of the old quarry outside of town cutting blocks of stone with a long copper saw. It normally took two people a quarter hour, but the dwarf sawed an entire block in two with a single stroke. The stones smoked as they fell, and the copper saw glowed with heat.\n\nJohn and Embers watched silently as the dwarf hefted another massive stone onto the cutting block.\n\nThe dwarf spit into his hands and noticed the two out of the corner of his eye. He paused, walked over to grab his battle staff with the hourglass symbol of Zarok, Law-Giver at the tip. He walked back to the stone and leaned his staff against a tree stump within easy reach should he need to use it.\n\nHe went back to work.\n\n\"Good morning,\" John said.\n\nThe dwarf ignored them.\n\n\"I'm a friend of Morag the Wise Woman,\" John said. \"She said there was a high theochron of Zarok, Law-Giver around here working to earn his keep.\"\n\nThe dwarf paused. \"High theochron?\" he said. \"A lofty title. Far too lofty for a job such as this,\" he went back to work and a moment later there were two more smoking blocks. He cleared them away.\n\n\"There's a job for nine...\" John hesitated. *Ratcatchers* didn't seem appropriate. He went with his gut. \"Heroes. In Bedegar. A village looking for someone to stand against Lord Saxton.\"\n\n\"Mm. I have heard of this one,\" the dwarf said, seemingly uninterested. He hurled the smaller blocks into a pile and went to heft a new stone to cut. \"A foul tyrant. Well-suited to these times. Perhaps the people deserve him.\"\n\n\"No people *deserve* tyranny,\" Embers said, an edge in her voice. The dwarf appeared to notice her for the first time, peered at her, took in her raiment, and went back to work. \"Nine against Saxton.\" The dwarf carried the massive block over his head to the cutting stone. He shook his head in disbelief at what was being asked. \"How great the opposition?\"\n\nJohn told him.\n\nThe dwarf dropped the stone in astonishment and stared at the human and elf. Then he smiled. \"Hah. You know our traditions well, sir knight. You seek to grant me a glorious death leading desperate soldiers against impossible odds.\"\n\n\"Not that desperate,\" John said modestly.\n\n\"Yes.\" The dwarf looked at Embers again. \"By garb and reputation, I make you A Mist Curls Around Dying Embers, mistress of the Tower of Translation. You are no stranger to power. But your tower is fallen lady,\" he said. \"Seek you revenge? Or justice?\"\n\n\"I see no reason to choose,\" Embers said smoothly. \"In my case, as well as the case of these villagers, justice would *be* revenge.\"\n\nThe dwarf's head snapped to look at Sir John. \"She speaks my language as well it seems. You are of a kind, you two.\"\n\n\"Three,\" John dared.\n\nThe dwarf failed to stifle a smile. \"And what is your stake in this?\" John shrugged. \"I've already been paid,\" he said. He fished around in a pouch on his belt. \"Here, I'll split it with you, fair and square.\"\n\nJohn flicked a coin off his finger with his thumb. It spun and glinted as it arced across the space between them. The dwarf snatched it from the air, opened his palm and stared at it. Something in his face changed. Softened. He looked at the nearby town that had adopted him. Peasants doing labor in the fields.\n\nHe clenched his fist around the coin. \"A princely sum,\" he said, mostly to himself.\n\n\"You are Dazar,\" Embers dared. \"High theochron in exile. Yours is the greatest dwarven church in all Omund's Land. Thousands look to you for spiritual guidance.\"\n\nThe dwarf said nothing. He looked at the coin in his hand.\n\n\"You left your people,\" Embers said quietly.\n\n\"My people left me!\" Dazar barked. \"When they embraced Ajax!\" Embers just watched the dwarf. His rage subsided as quickly as it came.\n\n\"I thought... I thought leaving might inspire my people to...\" He looked at the nearby village. \"Eh, it matters not. I could not have stayed in any event. I lack the stomach for tyranny.\"\n\n\"Kal Kalavar's new thane is not an easy problem to solve,\" John said with sympathy. \"Saxton is.\"\n\nThe dwarf looked up at Embers, \"Her I know by reputation.\" He turned to look at John.\n\nJohn bowed slightly. \"John,\" he said.\n\nDazar looked at his armor, the age and weather of it, and made an intuitive leap. \"You served under the Good King.\"\n\nJohn pursed his lips. \"That was a long time ago.\"\n\nDazar shook his head once. \"Not to me.\" He picked up his battlestaff and stepped forward. \"I knew him, you see. Omund was a fine king. The best we'll see even in a life as long as mine.\"\n\nNo one spoke for a moment. \"These people,\" Dazar said. \"These villagers. Do they know what they ask?\"\n\nJohn didn't answer.\n\n\"Do they know that asking us for help, asking *you*,\" Dazar looked Sir John up and down \"... means starting something they *must* see through to the end? It means hardship, privation, *death* buying a future for their children? You told them this?\"\n\nJohn shook his head.\n\n\"Well why not?!\" Dazar demanded. \"You of all people must understand...\"\n\n\"Dazar,\" John said, and his measured voice was a quick counter to Dazar's protest. \"These people are already at their wits' end. Just... just surviving, putting food on the table, keeping their children warm. Giving them *hope*. It's already more than should be asked of anyone. And then coming to us, swallowing their pride. Asking us for aid.\n\n\"It's our job to understand the job *for* them.\" Then, quieter, John added, \"And forgive them, ahead of time, for when they weaken, and give in to fear.\"\n\nDazar stared at the man, this knight of Tor, and looked at Embers quietly radiating pride in her friend.\n\n\"Hmm,\" Dazar grunted. He opened a pouch on his chest armor and inserted the coin. \"We must find a troubadour, to tell the tale of Saxton's fall. I cannot wait to hear how it ends!\" He walked between them, carrying his staff over his shoulder.\n\n\"Come!\" he barked. \"There's a world needs mending! Why stand we here idle?\"\n\nJohn was grinning madly at Embers. She held up three fingers.",

    "description": "In spite of their friendly, outgoing nature, the rare presence of a hakaan in human society is considered a harbinger. An omen of dark times.\n\nDescended from a tribe of giants in upper Vanigar, the original Haka'an tribe made a bargain with Holkatya the Vanigar trickster god. They traded some of their gigantic size and strength for the ability to see the future.\n\nBut Holkatya betrayed them, and the only future a hakaan is allowed to see is the moment and nature of their own death. These visions are never of some mundane tragedy. No hakaan ever received a vision of dying from choking on a grape. This Doomsight is always momentous. Always dramatic.\n\nThe Doomsight can happen at any moment. It does not come for all or even most hakaan, but when it comes, it is considered an act of overwhelming hubris to ignore it. Trying to escape the Doomsight means a painful, tragic death, and cursing your family to live with shame.\n\nBut the only hakaan the average human meets is one trying to fulfill their doom. The human superstition—that the arrival of one or more hakaan in human lands is a sign of great forces acting in the world, auspicious times—is literally true. In dark times, many hakaan experience the Doomsight and leave their communities to venture out into the mundane world, in search of their destiny.\n\nHumans in Vanigar have their own word for this concept of a personal fate. \"Wyrd.\" Traditional hakaan sometimes refer to the Doomsight as \"wyrdken.\"",
    "lore": "The gate, or door, or whatever it was started to close. With Dazar on the other side of it.\n\n\"Embers!\" John called out, but the high elf was surrounded. At that moment, a detonation. An explosion of sound that knocked the demons back. And a giant stood before the lumbering egress.\n\nDust settled on the ground behind the giant, and John realized the thunderclap was the sound of the giant running to them. Air that couldn't get out of the way fast enough, tortured by the pressure of his speed.\n\nThe rectangular, toothed egress demon was twelve feet tall at least, the giant almost matching its immense size.\n\nIn the instant before the maw of teeth and eyeballs shut, the giant grabbed each side of the mouth, and pulled. Muscles the size of hounds bulged. Tendons like ship cables stood taught, quivering with strain. \"Not today!\" the giant shouted. \"Not TODAY!!\"\n\nAs the giant forced the maw open, glowing tentacles writhed out of it, wrapping around the giant's arms, legs, neck. \"Hahah!\" the figure laughed. \"You'll find... MY flesh...\" the giant's bravado hid the fact that he was at the uttermost limits of his strength. \"... too RICH... for your taste!\"\n\nJohn knew what the giant did not—the tendrils drained life, sapped energy. The living portal would gain the strength it needed to defeat the giant by drinking his own life force.\n\nBut the arrival of the giant changed the equation. John saw a new solution. The hakaan risked his life to buy them options, and Sir John of Tor would not let the giant risk his life in vain.\n\nKicking the styrich back gave John room to move, and he dashed toward Embers. A shout, and a thrust into the soulraker's back, and the demons surrounding Embers turned to face Sir John.\n\nHe had to focus so intently on the demons who now surrounded him, he wasn't even sure Embers knew what to do. But he needn't have worried. When he risked a glance, she was already gone. A light fall of starstuff the only evidence she had translated into void.\n\nDispatching a chimeron, John saw Embers emerge from the other side of the egress demon with Dazar in her arms. John couldn't tell if Dazar was conscious. He might even be dead. Who knew what lurked on the other side of that living portal to the Abyssal Waste?\n\nThe hakaan struggled against the living gateway to that blasted world. One leg buckled and the stone warrior fell to one knee. The door would take him just as it took their dwarf conduit.\n\nThen, rising behind the egress demon, the high theocron, his battlestaff glowing.\n\n\"Back!\" Dazar conduit of Zarok, Law-Giver shouted, smashing at the flesh of the living doorway with his battlestaff. \"To hell!\" He swung again.\n\nThe doorway quivered and bled, and the giant stood up. \"Yes!\" He called out. \"YES!\"\n\nJohn and Embers joined the fight. The gamble, unspoken, was that the summoned demons would evaporate if their living portal were destroyed. It paid off.\n\nThey only had a moment before the demons swarmed them, but a moment was all it took before the hakaan shouted and finally ripped the bloody egress demon apart with his bare hands.\n\nThe demons in midstride all turned inside out, leaving bubbling, steaming pools of organs, eyeballs, and teeth on the ground. Leaving four heroes gasping from the fight.\n\n\"I told you...\" Dazar said, hands on his knees. \"Not to open! That book!\"\n\n\"You didn't say 'Don't open that,'\" John said, leaning back and gulping air. \"You just said it was dangerous. I knew it was dangerous!\"\n\n\"Well met!\" The giant laughed at the two friends squabbling.\n\n\"Well met indeed,\" Sir John said getting his breathing under control as the group gathered before the giant. \"Thank you for rescuing my friend.\"\n\n\"I had the situation under control,\" Dazar muttered, all evidence to the contrary.\n\n\"Of a surety!\" The giant's humor matched his size. \"It was my honor to grant thee aid, nothing more.\"\n\n\"You've been following us for a while,\" Embers said. John wondered what she meant.\n\n\"From the beginning,\" the giant said enigmatically.\n\n\"Don't take this the wrong way,\" John confessed, \"but I was afraid we'd meet a barrow-man on this journey.\"\n\nThe giant smiled \"Fear? At a meeting of friends? Ah these must be treacherous times indeed if simple folk like us have cause to fear meeting strangers.\"\n\n\"No offense,\" John said. \"It's just that... well... we only ever see one of you when you come down from the hills. Following your doom. Which is usually a...\" John tried to find a less dramatic way to say it, but nothing came to mind. \"A tiding of ill-omen.\"\n\n\"You are following your wyrd,\" Embers said.\n\nThe giant shook his head. \"Following my brother. He hurtles headlong to meet his doom, which I deem is bound up in this matter of this Sky Tyrant.\"\n\n\"Ajax,\" Dazar said. And the hakaan could hear the darkness in his voice.\n\n\"Aye. I did not understand why his path and yours seemed coincident, but now I think it has something to do with the thing they all seek, his demons.\"\n\nJohn looked at Embers. \"One of the Eleven Who Shall Not Be Named,\" she said. \"The fifth, I suspect. They were the elite deathless servants of the Lord of Swords who once ruled this land, many ages ago. Ajax is collecting the artifacts of ancient emperors. And their servants too, it seems.\"\n\nThe giant nodded solemnly. \"You are lorewise. My trust in you was well-placed. I am Ardashir,\" he placed one palm on his forehead, the other over his heart, and bowed his head once. \"It would be my pleasure to journey with you awhile. Stalwart allies are rare and precious in these times.\" He grinned. \"Good company even more so.\"\n\n\"No armor, no sword or staff,\" Dazar noticed. \"Hakaan do not use weapons?\"\n\n\"Many do!\" Ardashir said. \"I do not. I left the hills of my people long ago to pursue a different path. A path of order and discipline. It is my birthright perhaps.\"\n\n\"He's a null,\" Embers explained. \"They eschew all weapons and implements of war. It is part of their creed, as I understand it.\"\n\n\"Strength alone might serve,\" Dazar nodded, \"when the strength is such as yours.\"\n\nArdashir grinned. \"Strength alone is not enough.\" He assumed a fighting pose, hands clenched, arms in a guarding position before him. \"Discipline, training, focus. These are my implements.\"\n\n\"Well you can't ever be disarmed,\" John said. \"That could be useful.\" Ardashir's smile was brilliant. \"I suffice,\" he said.",

    "lore": "\"They're so beautiful,\" Wenna said. \"It's hard to imagine we're in danger.\"\n\n\"It's not that hard,\" Dade said darkly.\n\nThe five children stood alone in the center of a large circular courtyard open to the sky, their wode elf escort Llyander at their side. Lord Tear, King of the High Elves, sat on a marble throne, holding the scroll of the *Codex Dryadalis* in his lap. He had not spoken since Llyander made their speech and handed the codex over. The members of the court, nobles and courtiers and learned sages, gathered to watch. Implacable warriors in golden plate with fine filigree etched into the metal stood guard around the perimeter.\n\n\"They seem like...\" Meliora said, searching for the words.\n\n\"Like the lords of all the world,\" Wenna said with awe and wonder. \"And we are their prisoners,\" Jeremy said, looking at his brother Dade and Credan beside him.\n\n\"You're not prisoners,\" Llyander said quietly. \"You are guests. You're safer here than you would be even in your own homes.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Jeremy said, looking at the nearest guards with their longspears and swords. \"We feel very safe.\"\n\n\"Who are you kidding?\" Dade said. \"Everyone knows how much elves hate humans.\"\n\nAt this, Lord Tear exchanged a look with Llyander, consort to Queen Imyrr. It was a knowing look, full of sadness and melancholy. Then he broke his silence.\n\n\"Show me an elf who hates humans,\" he said, his voice deep and sonorous, \"and I will show you an elf who loved a human and watched them grow old and die.\" He looked at the children for the first time and smiled a melancholy smile. \"Love is like sunlight for us, you see. We love completely but rarely. The loss of it means an eternity of grief for us.\"\n\nThe king tapped the scroll against his lap, seeming to have reached a decision.\n\n\"Well done, consort. Young humans, your escort here seeks to shame me. For they know well they could have taken this prize to their queen and earned her favor. Instead, Llyander brought it to me in the hopes that by doing so, they deliver me the power necessary to throw off the yoke of Ajax's rule. Long has Llyander resented the decision I made and sought to change it...\"-he looked at Llyander-\"... by changing my mind.\"\n\nLlyander nodded deferentially, silently congratulating the king on his insight.\n\n\"Alas, your escort's efforts are for naught.\" Then the king's face became softer. He held up the heavy scroll. \"But this is not nothing,\" he said. \"We made a treaty with Ajax to deliver unto him any artifacts our search teams discover from the ruins of this city. He benefits from this bargain more than we. But this, methinks, will stay with us. It was written by my grandmother's grandmother in the youth of the world, and there are some things which must be denied the Iron Saint, even should they violate the treaty.\"\n\nLlyander turned to the children and smiled brilliantly, eyebrows waggling in a show of glee. Wenna and Credan couldn't help but smile. \"Well, you see children?\" Llyander said. \"We only have *more* to do, not everything to do.\"\n\nThe king stood up and a herald beside the throne announced, \"Gather ye, and attend! The Lord of Fallen Irranys, Morning Dew on a Single Leaf Like a Tear from the Sun, speaks. And know his word is law!\"\n\nLord Tear glided down the steps until he was standing, as tall as Llyander, before the children. His face was noble and beautiful. Wisps of silver-like strands of smoke spread across his golden skin. He seemed at once eternal and youthful.\n\n\"You have heard many things about my people, but this above all you should know. We do not value lore for lore's sake, but beauty first and above all other things. And the truth, to us, is a kind of beauty. Thus do we find knowledge beautiful.\n\n\"You have returned something not only of enormous worldpower, but at the same time, a work of art my ancient relative labored over for many of your centuries. It is something of a miracle that it is returned to me now. I will not forget this. You have made an ally of the lord of the high elves. And though you lead brief lives, while you live, you shall have the favor of the elves.\" He turned to hand the scroll over to a sage and confer with his herald.\n\n\"He seems wise,\" Credan said.\n\n\"And smart,\" Meliora said.\n\n\"I'm surprised how kind he is,\" Jeremy said. \"He seems a good king.\" Llyander chuckled. Wenna noticed. She didn't say anything at first, but eventually she couldn't resist. \"What?\"\n\nLlyander raised an eyebrow, then walked in front of the children so that as the wode elf spoke, their back was to the king.\n\n\"Do you remember when my cousin's soldiers hid in the wode?\" they said, their voice low. \"How astonished you were?\"\n\nWenna and Meliora nodded. Llyander nodded to the guards and guests. \"This is *their* glamor. Whatever you find pleasant and attractive in another? That is what you see in them. If you value good humor, they are jesters. If you value beauty, they are breathtaking. If you find intelligence attractive, they are sages. It is not just an effect of appearance, though it is also that. It is one of *demeanor*.\"\n\n\"But how do they *do*...\"\n\nLlyander put a finger to their lips, silencing young Meliora. \"It is not a thing they *do*. It is an effect in your *mind*.\"\n\n\"You mean they don't even know they're doing it?\" Meliora asked.\n\n\"Then what do they really look like?\" Wenna asked.\n\nLlyander shrugged. \"What does anyone really look like?\" And while the other children chalked this up to their escort's normally abstruse mode of communication, Meliora caught a glimpse of understanding somewhere in her mind.\n\nThe king turned back to them. \"Should any of you seek hidden lore or deep wisdom, please allow me to serve you first. But you, young woman, the human child who learned our language, I name thee *elf friend*. And my naming carries power. You will find the learning of our lore will come more quickly to you, and all those who still revere the elves will give you safe passage in their lands.\"\n\nLlyander put their hands on their hips and regarded the children. \"Not bad for your second quest. What shall you do for an encore?\"",

    "description": "Humans belong to the world in a way the other speaking peoples do not. You can sense the presence of the supernatural—that... oily smell in the air, as I've heard it described. And the presence of deathless causes the hairs on the back of your neck to stand up. Or why do you think graveyards affect you so? Whatever magic is, its grip on you is light. Whatever drives the deathless, your nature rebels against it.\n\n\"No one knows why this should be. We elves have no such senses. Nor do the elementals or the kanin... the dwarves and the orcs as you say. What is it that sets humans apart? I am an historian, not a physician. I cannot say. Perhaps some of you will one day find out and teach us all the reason.\"",
    "lore": "So, we arrive here at the end of your first semester of Human Culture. I hope to see you next year in the Caelian Empire course, and though it may be hard to believe now, I often see former students' names in our textbooks years later. Perhaps that will be some of you.\n\nI will now answer the one question I am asked most often, and which I save answering until the last day of class. What do I think of humans?\n\nI am a high elf, as you deem it in your tongue. A child of the solar celestials. And I have taught this class, mostly to young humans, for thirteen centuries. I have seen generations of your people come through this classroom, and that alone would well qualify me to answer this question.\n\nWhat do I think of humans? Well, I will tell you.\n\nI was here, teaching this class during the fire of Chaos 373. The fire *leveled this city*. Can you imagine that? Can you imagine the heat, the death, destruction that such a thing causes?\n\n*Six months* after the Great Fire, your ancestors had rebuilt... everything. I have seen many miracles in my life. Witnessing that feat might be chief among them.\n\nLiches are almost always humans. Did you know that? I think I know why. Your lives are so short—almost as soon as you're born, you're thinking about dying, and you refuse to yield.\n\nThat refusal to yield to death... to *death*... is what drives you, I think. Drives you to leave the world better than you found it. Causes ruined people to rebuild great city.\n\nWe studied human history in this room. Did you feel that those great ancestors of yours were perhaps made of finer stuff than you? Do not think thus. I knew them, and I know you, and your future is greater. I sometimes think each human generation greater than the last—more courageous, more generous. Quicker to forgive.\n\nToday, Ajax's name is on everyone's tongue, but we learned of many great evils that plagued this world. We met the Pharaoh Khorsekef, desperate, his power failing, as he opened the Great Tet and drank of the time stored there, becoming the Ultralich. He was defeated, and now rules the Necropolitan Ruin in the Abyssal Waste.\n\nWe watched Cthrion Uroniziir try to reduce the timescape into one singular universe, wiping out reality as we know it. She was defeated, and we see her cage every day.1\n\nEach of these great evils was defeated by a coalition. The armies and heroes of many speaking peoples. And all of them—all of them—were led... by humans. That's a fact. That's history. You can look it up.\n\nIs there some rare trait that makes you uniquely qualified to lead disparate peoples, bring them together to achieve great things? I think... there must be.\n\nThose great humans, your ancestors, did not focus on differences. They did not *weigh* different people and grade them based on arbitrary traits deemed virtues and flaws. That is what Ajax does. No, those humans focused on the future. On making a better world... for all of us. A world many of them knew they would not live to see. That is a sacrifice... I can scarcely imagine.\n\nThe people who stand against Ajax and tyrants like him will be just like you—normal people. Priests and scholars and merchants and farmers. Maybe even teachers.\n\nStopping Ajax will require you to become something else. You must become heroes. Conduits of saints, warmasters of great armies. Censors and shadows. That may seem unlikely now, but the future has a way of surprising us.\n\nSome of your names, I will see written in future textbooks. But some of your names, I will see written in the stars.",

But when descending to the lower planes, including a manifold like Orden where law and chaos mix, a sickness comes over them—an uncontrollable sensation called emotion.",
    "lore": "\"You want to tell me what just happened?\" Sir John asked. Count Revile avoided his gaze, then turned and stamped across the bloody battlefield. \"I'm fine!\" Revile shouted, all evidence to the contrary.\n\n\"I know what I saw,\" John said as he followed his friend. \"You went into a *bloodlust*. And it's not the first time. Listen!\" John shouted, uncharacteristically, trying to get the count to pay attention. \"You *asked* me for help, remember? You want to get home,\" John gestured to the sky, \"... and you asked for help and I *said*, 'Do you remember?' I said, '*Is there anything else we should know?*'\n\n\"Now I *meant*, 'Is there anyone coming after you we need to know about?' But it's starting to *seem like* there's something wrong with *you*. That you *knew about* and *chose* not to tell me.\"\n\nVithyaranu, Count of the ALAV *Revile* paced back and forth, his cloak billowing. John continued.\n\n\"Listen, whether you like it or not, whether I like it or not, I'm in charge of this mission. Either you tell me what's going on, or I have no choice. I *have* to conclude you're a danger to the team and cut you loose.\"\n\nRevile stopped and turned to look at the rest of the party, recovering from their wounds. The memonek's white porcelain chest heaved as he tried to calm himself. His ceramic skin looked as strong as plate, but John knew it was brittle, fragile.\n\nCount Revile took a deep breath. \"We call it *velloparatha*,\" he said. \"In your tongue it would be... worldsick. Or world-sickness? It is a thing that happens... to my people... when they come to your world. It is an illness of... of feeling. Emotion.\"\n\n\"Are you going mad?\" John asked, his voice quiet. He wanted to give the count a chance to answer privately.\n\nThe memonek smiled ruefully. \"It feels that way sometimes. I spent an hour this morning staring at an insect that landed on my finger. A *grasshopper* the dwarf called it. I thought I had never seen a thing so perfect and beautiful. That was awe. As powerful as I have ever felt. In the battle today, anger. Just as powerful.\n\n\"I thought I could resist it. When I arrived here and felt no different I thought perhaps worldsickness was a legend. But it is a slow process, this illness. These insidious emotions.\"\n\n\"No emotions where you're from?\"\n\nCount Revile shook his head. \"Not like this. We are creatures of reason, we of Axiom. It is our art, our pride. Our religion sometimes methinks. We have emotions; joy, sadness, wonder, grief. But they are... a fashion. They do not *happen* to us; they are something we indulge in, out of propriety. Here... everything is order and chaos mixed. Even in *me*. In me.\" Revile placed his hand on his chest.\n\n\"In the battle today. That anger was not directed at Ajax's war dogs. It was at myself.\"\n\n\"At yourself ? Why? What did you...?\"\n\n\"John,\" the memonek said, and now it was his turn to whisper. \"I was afraid. Afraid of... of being wounded, of failing you, failing my friends. Of dying. And out of that fear came... enormous anger. At myself. Anger that I was so weak so... useless. Anger so... strong, so powerful... I forgot who I was.\"\n\nJohn chuckled. \"That's just...\" He smiled broadly. \"That's just normal. We all feel that way.\"\n\n\"What? No, you don't understand...\"\n\n\"Oh I don't understand, okay, let me guess. It felt like you were gonna *piss* yourself.\"\n\n\"Yes!!\"\n\n\"Yeah, happens to all of us.\"\n\n\"Even you?!\"\n\nSir John shrugged. \"Are you kidding? Sure. But it doesn't help. You still got a job to do. In fact I'd say that *is* the job. Anyone can learn the blade.\" He placed his hand on the pommel of his sword. \"Nothing special about that. It's learning to deal with the *fear*. That's the job. What separates the professionals from the amateurs.\"\n\nCount Revile said nothing, just thought.\n\n\"Feeling better?\"\n\nRevile nodded. \"I always recover afterwards. But these outbursts come unbidden. Like thunder from a clear sky.\"\n\n\"Hm. Yeah. Well that explains what happened when you met Embers.\"\n\nCount Revile did not like being reminded of that. He looked to the sky and shook his head. \"I made a fool of myself.\"\n\n\"Don't be so hard on yourself. If you're trying to seduce our void mage you made a good start of it. She's three hundred years old. I've known her since I was fifteen. I don't think I've ever seen her *blush*. Anyway, now that I know what's going on, now that I know you're basically a giant teenager with overactive glands, I can relax a little.\"\n\nEmbers approached and handed John a small, heavy object. She looked at the two men then walked away.\n\n\"She was right,\" John said looking at the iridoss starcore. \"They didn't know what it was, but they sure as hell didn't want us to get it.\n\n\"Here,\" John said, handing the engine over to Count Revile. \"I guess you're free to go.\"\n\nRevile looked at the elaborate cage of brass and glass holding a swirling blue starfield. \"I guess I am,\" he said. He looked at Sir John. \"I didn't expect our friendship to be so short.\"\n\nJohn smiled and maybe blushed a little. \"Well,\" he said looking at the rest of the crew, \"being one of my friends these days is a hazardous profession.\"\n\nThe count just got more serious. \"I was lucky to meet one such as you on this world.\"\n\nJohn shrugged. \"Only world I've ever known.\"\n\nCount Revile hefted the starcore. \"I have responsibilities to keep. I will return home and this place will be only a memory.\" The count was openly sad. \"And you can forget about the alien you rescued and his ship of glass and steel.\"\n\n\"Oh, I doubt that,\" John said. \"But I'll tell you this. I'll never look at the stars the same way again.\"\n\nJohn offered his hand. Revile shook it and then held it.\n\n\"If there are many like you in this world of gods and sorcery,\" the noble memonek star captain said, \"then your victory over evil is assured.\"\n\n\"I don't know about many,\" John said, extricating his hand. He looked at the dwarf, elf, and hakaan.\n\n\"But there might be enough.\"",

Orcs are famed throughout the world as consummate warriors—a reputation that the peace—loving orcs find distasteful.\n\nThe fifth of the speaking peoples, orcs arrived on Orden after humans and elves. They made their homes in the borderlands between those two cultures, preferring the natural forests and avoiding the elf-haunted wodes. For generations, this put them directly in the path of humans who cut down the trees and built roads and farms.\n\nEach orc has within them a fire that causes their veins to glow once blood is drawn. This anger propels them right to the edge of death. The dichotomy between their desire to be left alone and their zeal in battle is summarized in a dwarf proverb:\n\n\"Be thankful orcs do not hold grudges.\"",
    "lore": "The orc pulled her greataxe from the split skull of the newly dead ogre. Prone heroes scrambled to their feet. Dazar healed the wounded.\n\nThe orc hopped down from the corpse of the defeated. \"Elg was a ruin ogre,\" she said. \"Infected with a troll disease. An inconvenience for troll-kin but to an ogre...\" She indicated the mutated ogre. \"You weren't to know.\"\n\n\"Oh, good,\" Sir John said with obvious relief. \"You speak Caelian.\" \"Yes.\" The orc said. She seemed distant. She gave John a look. \"I speak the language of your conquerors.\"\n\nJohn smiled. He liked this orc already.\n\n\"By the stars!\" Ardashir said with open joy on his face. \"You saved our lives. It *must* be you who we seek.\"\n\nKhorva looked at the assembled heroes. A motley band. \"You did most of the work,\" she said. She seemed disinterested in them and everything.\n\n\"You waited until we proved our mettle before acting!\" Dazar said, and from the way he spoke it was unclear if this was an accusation or mere observation.\n\n\"If you couldn't hold your own,\" the orc said, \"there'd be no point helping you.\" Her eyes rested on Sir John.\n\n\"John,\" he said.\n\n\"Khorva,\" the orc said.\n\n\"Of the Howling,\" John said.\n\n\"*Late* of the Howling,\" Khorva said, and looked into the forest with apparent disinterest. *Already on the back foot,* John thought. *Well if it was easy, it wouldn't be called a job.*\n\n\"We've been looking for you,\" Dazar said.\n\nKhorva nodded without looking at the dwarf.\n\n\"I surmised as much,\" she said. \"It seemed your plan was to wander around the wood until something tried to kill you in the hopes of attracting my attention.\"\n\n\"Well, we didn't have a lot of other options,\" John said. \"We seek the chieftain of the Howling.\"\n\n\"That is my brother.\"\n\nJohn looked at Embers. \"We were told the Howling was led by a woman.\"\n\nKhorva sighed and looked away into the forest. \"My sister died leaving my people leaderless. I tried to save her. I failed. I tried to lead in her stead. I failed.\" She said these things with no emotion, no inflection. Then her gaze dropped to the sandy ground and her eyes unfocused. A moment passed.\n\n\"How clever the dead are,\" she said, her voice a little hollow, \"to torment us from the grave.\"\n\nJohn saw the broken swords on her belt. \"Five swords,\" he said. \"Five broken swords.\" He looked at Khorva anew. \"I don't think I've ever seen an orc survived three challenges.\"\n\n\"They couldn't kill me and I wouldn't yield.\" She looked at the group of them skeptically. \"Four of you?\"\n\n\"We just got started,\" John said defensively. \"And I'm working on a friend of mine. We'll see. One of the Storm Knights.\"\n\nKhorva frowned. \"I thought the Dragon Phalanx were dead.\"\n\n\"Yeah well,\" John said, wishing Vaant was here to watch this. \"They couldn't kill him,\" he broke out in a feral grin. \"And he wouldn't yield.\"\n\nKhorva nodded once, impressed.\n\n\"We need the Howling,\" John said. \"If we get you your tribe back...?\" Khorva sighed and said nothing for several moments. After a while, she returned from her reverie to look at John.\n\n\"I'd rather go fishing.\"\n\nJohn smiled. \"My sister liked fishing too.\"\n\n\"Why not talk to my brother?\"\n\n\"Because we are not fools,\" Embers said, and Khorva locked eyes with her, standing a little straighter. The orc's brown eyes burned and it seemed the group rose somewhat in her estimation. She nodded once. \"The folk of farm and field go to war,\" Dazar said, using the orcish term for humans. \"A war against Lord Saxton and his priest.\"\n\nKhorva turned to John. \"How is this your matter?\"\n\nJohn tried to find a way to tell the story that wouldn't take all day. He kicked at a stone with his boot as he thought.\n\n\"A family came to me. They're desperate. Their village is desperate. They can either die, or fight. And they cannot fight. So they hired me.\"\n\nKhorva raised an eyebrow. \"How much did they buy you for?\" \"Nine copper bits.\"\n\nKhorva stared at him. \"That's nothing\"\n\nJohn shrugged. \"It was everything they had. The village sold everything they had left.\"\n\nJohn relaxed as he saw Khorva's eyes soften. She understood.\n\n\"A difficult offer to refuse,\" she said.\n\n\"Aye.\" Dazar nodded solemly.\n\nKhorva looked up to watch three crows idly circling, rising, riding a heat haze into the sky. \"How many is the opposition?\"\n\n\"Saxton has no regulars. Just some knights, we can take care of them. But he has the Whitewater. Led by Bonebreaker Dorokor. That's three companies of elite light orc foot against a handful of peasant levies. We need the Howling.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Khorva said, and turned away from the crows to look out over the heroes. \"I know Dorokor, she is not like my brother. A head of meat and muscle. Dorokor is a thinker. You seek the Howling because you seek a counter to the Whitewater.\" She looked at John. \"But even better, *talk* to Dorokor. Deny Saxton his pet orc clan, and *earn* the allegiance of the Whitewater.\"\n\n\"Is such a thing possible?\" Embers asked.\n\nA moment passed. Khorva didn't break eye contact with John. \"It's possible,\" she said.\n\n\"The Howling *or* the Whitewater tribe,\" Dazar said. \"Either would be a formidable foe in any battle, such is the reputation of orcish warlore.\"\n\nKhorva shook her head. \"Orcs have no great love for battle. We love trees and green things. We love an unspoiled land. For this reason did Kul place us in the world. The last of the original speaking peoples.\"\n\n\"But also did Kul place the fire within you,\" Embers said.\n\n\"Yes,\" Dazar added. \"You are not pacifists, you are warriors!\"\n\n\"We are pacifists,\" Khorva said with an emphasis that seemed almost a shout. Then a beat of silence and a smile played across her lips. \"And we are warriors.\"\n\n\"We're not here to make a deal,\" John said. \"We're not for sale and neither are you. This is about righting a wrong. It's about helping people.\" He paused and something unrehearsed, unbidden came from his lips.\n\n\"It's about living with yourself. Sleeping at night.\"\n\n\"Battles do not bring restful sleep,\" Khorva said. \"The opposite, I find.\" \"Battles bring glory! Battles make heroes!\" Dazar insisted, and John felt like he learned something about the dwarf in that moment. He could hear that Dazar believed this to be true, and knew it was a lie. It was a test.\n\n\"War makes only one thing. Corpses.\" Khorva looked down at the high theochron, who nodded. Test passed.\n\n\"And veterans,\" Sir John said. \"Who covet peace.\" Khorva nodded. Respect. \"Aye,\" she said. She looked at each hero then at John again.\n\n\"Well,\" she said. \"What do we do next?\"",

Almost every human culture in Orden has a polder saint or a human saint venerated by polder.\n\nShort, averaging 31/2 feet tall, the polders' origins are obscure. They are a young species who, like humans, have no single patron god. Their ability to *shadowmeld* means they enjoy a reputation as excellent spies and thieves. Many polders consider this a base slander and point out they're also famed as chefs, though polders can be found in every profession, especially in cities.",
    "lore": "The three peasants—Jago, his wife Sarah, and his sister Beth—sat together watching the three heroes talk in the crowded common room of the inn. Well, Jackson Bootblack seemed to be doing most of the talking.\n\n\"This kind of shit doesn't work if it's just a bunch of ratcatchers like us,\" the polder said. \"You need the people to rise up. Been fifteen years since Omund died—fifteen years of fighting wolves and bandits and worse. The people welcome a tyrant after that. They like order, you know? They adapt.\"\n\n\"If you stand on the grass long enough, it learns to lie flat,\" A Mist Curls Around Dying Embers said. \"But what do *you* say?\"\n\n\"Eh?\" the polder asked her. But he glanced at Sir John staring at him. \"You say the people have no stomach for rebellion,\" Embers said. \"But what about you?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" the polder said, \"I say it doesn't matter much what I say. Why's he looking at me like that?\" he asked the high elf and pointed at Sir John. Realizing he was being rude, John shook his head to clear it. \"Sorry, I just... I never met a polder before,\" he said.\n\n\"Are you kidding me?\" Jackson said.\n\n\"No! Sorry, I just...\"\n\n\"What are you, from the moon? Where you from that you never met a polder before? There's polder in every fucking village and town from here to the sea.\"\n\n\"Really? That's weird. I'm from Tor, I've been all over—just never met a polder before.\"\n\nJackson looked at his friend, the high elf void mage. \"Am I crazy?\" \"You're not crazy.\" Embers smiled. She was enjoying watching two of her friends get to know each other. \"John's just never run into one, it seems.\"\n\n\"Well, we're adorable,\" the polder said, and drank some ale. \"They must have been around I guess,\" John said. \"I probably just never noticed.\"\n\nThe polder put his drink down. \"Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. You know, it's funny. I never have any problem noticing you big assholes. One of you makes about as much noise as a cow, which... I don't even know how you manage that.\"\n\n\"You're talking just... my voice is just as loud as yours!\"\n\n\"I mean the way you walk around. Just the way you move, the way you stand up and sit down. You make so much goddamn noise.\"\n\nJago, Sarah, and Beth all smiled at the exchange.\n\n\"Humans are loud, yes,\" Embers agreed.\n\n\"Do we have to... can we talk about something else, please?\" John said.\n\n\"I just...\" The polder wouldn't let it go. \"You seriously never... you never been to an inn? Cavall's teeth, I can't count how many inns and taverns I've been to run by polders, got polders in the kitchen or waiting tables. One of the only two things we're good at, I think.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\" John asked. \"What's the other one?\"\n\nThe little man smiled. \"Getting into places we ain't supposed to be.\" \"Now we're talking,\" Sir John said. \"You were saying we need the people behind us. I agree.\"\n\n\"Yeah, okay. To business: How to rally the people.\" The polder took the question seriously. \"It's not hard. First, we need someone they'll rally around. I could make someone up, invent a local folk hero, but if we can find the real thing? They just need to look the part, that's all. I'll take care of the rest.\"\n\n\"I'm working on that,\" John said. \"But it's... slower going than I thought. I'm betting on a long shot.\"\n\n\"What's the holdup?\"\n\nJohn thought about how to put what he knew into words. \"You know...\" He shrugged. \"Some people can only be heroes if they think they're better than everyone else. Some people can only be heroes once they realize they're not. And some people...\"\n\nHe looked at his drink, at the expensive clear glass the innkeep had given him because he recognized Sir John. He turned the glass slowly on the table, and now he was mostly talking to himself. \"Some people still have to figure that out.\"\n\n\"Which is best?\" Jackson asked, and Embers could tell the little man was testing John.\n\nJohn took a deep breath and came back to reality. \"Well. If we could be picky, we wouldn't need a hero,\" he said.\n\nThe polder looked at the high elf and nodded, impressed. Test passed. \"Okay. Well, if you've already got a candidate, I could get things started. The other half is: We need a good story—short, punchy. Something that'll catch on, needs to be easy to relate to, but bigger than life. A tax. A toll! Bridge toll, classic. An ogre... no, three ogres. Yeah, three is better. Three ogres in Ajax's livery. A lone figure standing against them. See? Easy.\"\n\n\"Where are we going to find three ogres?\" John asked.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Now it was the polder's turn to be confused. \"What do you mean, 'What do I mean?'\" John said.\n\n\"I'm not... we don't need *real* ogres.\" Jackson looked at the elf. \"Is he for real?\"\n\n\"Trust me,\" the void mage said.\n\n\"You mean you're going to make it up?!\" John exclaimed.\n\n\"I...\" Jackson looked with incredulity at the high elf void mage, then back at the human. \"Yes, I do mean that. Does he know what I do?\" he asked the elf.\n\n\"He'll learn.\" Embers smiled.\n\nThe polder turned back to Sir John. \"Hello. I lie for a living. And I'm *really good at it*. Sometimes also kill people, but only if lying or running away doesn't work.\"\n\nJohn turned to Embers. \"I thought he was a thief.\"\n\n\"I was a thief,\" the polder said.\n\n\"You *were* a thief.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I was with the Clock. Probably still am—they don't exactly let you just walk away. We sort of have an agreement. I agree to do what they tell me and they agree not to tell me to do anything.\"\n\n\"Did they kick you out, or did you quit?\"\n\n\"Depends on who you ask. I don't like being told what to do. It's sort of a polder thing. Hereditary or ancestral or whatever. Everybody wants a polder chef until they start trying to tell us what to cook.\"\n\n\"So what are you now?\"\n\n\"I'm annoying.\"\n\nThe elf smiled. \"He's a troubadour—one of the best.\"\n\nSir John looked at him, nodded. \"No lute, I notice. And you don't seem the type to sit by the hearth telling stories.\"\n\nThe polder grinned. \"I ain't that kind of troubadour. I'm the other kind. I think the best story is the one people tell each other.\"\n\n\"Propaganda,\" Sir John said, a grin spreading across his face. The polder pointed a finger at him and smiled. John heard the door to the inn open behind him. This wasn't notable, but the gasp from the customers was.\n\n\"Hey,\" the polder said, looking past John to the doorway. \"Hey, I think our folk hero just showed up. Damn, he looks the part all right. Or she, I can never tell with these guys.\"\n\nJohn turned to see.\n\nSir Vaantikalisax loomed just inside the doorway, his scales and armor glowing in the light of the hearth fire. Sir John shot up out of his chair, a huge smile on his face.\n\n\"I, uh...\" Vaantikalisax said. The tall, broad draconian looked from John to the three peasants. Jago, Sarah, and Beth were beaming with even more joy than John, if that were possible.\n\nThe dragon knight stared at them for a moment, then turned back to his friend.\n\n\"Maybe you're right,\" he said.",

Some of them are happier about it than others.\n\nUnlike the necromantic rituals that produce wights and wraiths and zombies, revenants rise from the grave through a combination of an unjust death and a burning desire for vengeance. Creatures sustained on pure will, they have no need of food or water or air—and, unlike their zombified cousins, they retain all their memories and personality from life.\n\nThese revenants are rare. Many are hunted by ignorant villagers who see only their dead flesh and assume the worst. Those who survive the pitchfork brigade either choose a solitary life, often as a wandering soul seeking out living company yet constantly in fear of it, or they migrate to a metropolis such as Blackbottom or Capital, where lost souls gather to make a home.",

We stash everything here, and take a sample to...\" The head thief pulled a vial out of a crate stuffed with straw and looked at it.\n\n\"It's just...\" The junior cutpurse spoke nervously. \"There was this lady knight in Blackbottom sniffing around. She seemed serious. I got this weird... chill when I looked at her.\"\n\n\"Hey,\" the head thief said, his brow furrowed as he looked at the label on the vial. \"Where'd you say you bought this stuff ? You said a ship—a ship from where?\"\n\n\"I dunno, uh... uh, Capital I think.\"\n\nThe head thief looked at the panicking cutpurse. \"This lady knight she have a red and blue device on her shield?\"\n\n\"It can't be Lady Filliamo, can it?\" one of the other thieves said. There was a firm knock at the door to the safe house. A door which,\n\nfrom the outside, looked like an unremarkable section of wall.\n\n\"Oh, you've got to be kidding me.\"\n\n\"Nonono! How could she... Capital was *nine months ago!*\"\n\n\"She's a revenant, idiot! She doesn't even need air. She could have walked here! Just... into the water and across the bottom of the sea! Why didn't you say anything?\"\n\n\"I did! You asshole, I just did! I been trying to tell you for-\"\n\n\"Man, there is a *difference* between, 'Hey I think we're being shadowed,' and, 'There's a deathless *copper* coming after us!'\"\n\nOne of the four thieves opened a vial and dipped his dirk into the red oil within.\n\n\"What is *that* gonna do? *She's already dead!*\" Another knock at the hidden door. \"Forget it. Let her knock. Grab as many as you can, and we'll go out the back.\"\n\nThe head thief ran for the door out the back of the safe house. He jerked it open—and the other thieves watched as a silver flash silently flared across his forehead. Through the open door, they could see the silhouette of the knight, her open hand held up in front of her.\n\nShe clenched her hand into a fist and the *judgment* she had placed on the head cutpurse detonated, hurling him backward. He sprawled across the floor, conscious but stunned.\n\nThe gray-skinned knight walked into the room. Metal heels rang out on the wooden floor. She seemed relaxed, but her eyes burned with inner fire.\n\n\"Boys,\" Lady Filliamo said pleasantly. \"Busy morning.\"\n\n\"How did you... this is impossible, how did you *find* us?\" She looked at the man groaning on the floor. \"Your boss didn't tell you about the vengeance mark?\"\n\n\"You marked us. Back in Capital. You marked one of us and just... just *walked* here.\"\n\n\"Don't be stupid. I marked you in Blackbottom. Capital was just normal detective work. I came here by *ship*.\" She smiled—black lips on pale gray skin.\n\n\"Come on.\" The braver of the three remaining thieves drew twin daggers. \"She can't get all of us at-\"\n\nLady Filliamo made a broad gesture with her right hand and argent marks flared across the foreheads of all three thieves. A clatter of weapons hitting the floor. Three pairs of hands slowly rose in the air. \"Good boys. Here, put these on.\" She tossed three pairs of manacles on the floor.\n\n\"Hang on, you can't arrest us,\" one of the thieves, unarmed and still holding his hands up, said. \"This isn't Capital. You don't have jurisdiction!\"\n\nLady Filliamo shrugged. \"I'm a knight of the church. Jurisdiction's for the city watch.\" She drew her silver sword a few inches from the scabbard just to show them the blade.\n\n\"*I deal in steel.*\"",

In the centuries since, they built their own culture and civilization as nomads of the timescape. The exonym \"time raiders\" was given to them by denizens of the lower worlds who, seeing the advanced technology the kuran'zoi wield, concluded they must be from the future.\n\nExtraordinarily rare in Orden, time raiders thrive on the Sea of Stars, the Sea Between Worlds, where the winds of limbo roar.\n\nIn place of eyes, kuran'zoi possess crystalline ocular sensors that grant them high-spectral vision and which are hardened against the extreme radiations encountered in the Sea of Stars, permitting them to operate freely outside their vessels with only their portable rebreathers. Time raiders also have two sets of arms, allowing them to wield melee weapons at the same time as ranged weapons. A single well-trained kuran'zoi is like a squad unto themself.",
    "lore": "\"You will tell me the location of the ship you came here in.\" Taxiarch Lycaon paced outside the ruined stone church. The four-armed woman with crystal eyes and flaming pink hair in a strip down the center of her shaved head sneered at him. She was chained to the ruin of a stone column outside the church.\n\n\"Is it that your brain is so small you must *talk* in order to *think*?\" The woman's smile was a sneer.\n\nLycaon strode toward the alien, grabbed a length of chain around her waist and yanked on it, pulling it taut so the chain around her neck tightened. \"You are going to die in any event,\" he said. \"If you wish to deny me the pleasure of hearing you howl and scream for mercy, tell me what I want to know now and my dogs will kill you quickly.\"\n\nUp close, she could see the fine stitching along Lycaon's cheeks and forehead, the very slight differences in skin tone that showed his skin was not his own.\n\n\"You seem to be made of *bits*,\" the alien said as she peered at Lycaon, her crystalline eyes catching and reflecting prismatic light. \"And not the best bits. Leftovers? Is that what you are? A walking assemblage of castoff *scraps*? Hahah, I thought the proteans were hideous. Someone should let them know! There are creatures even more foul-seeming and *useless* in the timescape.\"\n\nThe taxiarch smiled to himself, nodded with respect at the woman's epithets. He placed his foot on a low piece of rubble, once part of the wall of the stone church, and leaned his arm on his knee. He was not dressed as the other war dogs. No black leather for him. He wore a gold breastplate with the embossed head of a ram molded into it, a white cape over his back. Gold greaves and red leather boots and gloves. The other war dogs only had patches of hair but his was long and blond.\n\nHe struck a casual, jaunty pose. \"Where is your worldship?\" he said in a more reasonable voice. \"Or came you here in a single-seater *starskimmer*?\" At this, the alien's crystal eyes went wide, betraying surprise. \"You see?\" the taxiarch said, impressed with himself. \"I am not a primitive like these peasants, who hounded you because you are alien.\" He nodded at the folk of the small town watching from the stables some distance away. \"I am Ajax's elite. Better than his chosen. I was *made* for victory.\" Indeed, Taxiarch Lycaon looked almost fully human. Handsome and fit like a statue from Phaedros, which his model had almost certainly been inspired by. Unless you looked closely, there was no sign he was a product of the body banks. \"If you agree to *lead me* to your vessel, I will let you go free.\"\n\nThe alien sighed. \"'Blaap blaap blaap,'\" she said. \"You should hear yourself. Like barking *thrazz*, you sound to me. Who holds your leash I wonder? For surely a microbrain such as you could not command any more than these rabble.\" She nodded her head at the other twenty or so war dogs.\n\nHer taunts worked. Lycaon hauled back and punched the alien in the jaw. Her head smashed into the ruined column. She was dazed but she shook it off and laughed.\n\n\"Look how easily this one is goaded!\" she said. She spat out dark-blue blood and turned to the peasants gathered. \"You people! Why do you let yourselves be cowed by these... *bits*? Bits of people kludged together? Even the least of you is worth more than these.\"\n\n\"Perhaps from the air,\" Flight Captain Lyria offered, and she stroked the feathers of her giant hawk mount to calm it. \"I could scout the forest around the...\"\n\n\"No!\" Taxiarch Lycaon pointed a finger at the Hawklord and strode toward her. \"*You* are the elite of Ajax's winged harriers, *I* am his chosen brigade commander. *We* are not scavengers! This one...\" he stabbed a gloved finger at the alien, \"... will come to heel, or I will give her to my war dogs.\" He turned to face the chained alien, who yawned. Lycaon seethed.\n\n\"They may pull you apart,\" he said to her, and at this his squadron of soldiers, all in black leather and golden pauldrons, started making barking sounds. Then they laughed at each other.\n\n\"Or I may let my crucibite melt the skin from your bones.\" At that, a war dog clad in leather from head to foot wearing a heavy mask with glass circles where the eyes should be and some kind of canister over his mouth stepped forward. The long thin brass tube in his hands connected to a large metal tank on his back.\n\n\"Shall I let you choose?\" the taxiarch said, and drew a dagger from his belt. \"I will cut off one finger. If you cry out, *I* kill you. If not, another finger. And if you cry out *then*...\"\n\nSlowly everyone assembled could make out the sounds of a conversation, quiet with a metallic ring to it. The voices got louder until eventually they could be heard.\n\n\"... should be ready for anything,\" one voice said, deep, commanding, and images started to form around and between the war dogs, the Hawklord, and the taxiarch. Like faded images in a manuscript they seemed, gaining pigment and clarity and, eventually, depth as their voices grew louder and clearer.\n\n\"Oh, thank you for the brilliant tactical advice,\" another voice, high pitched, piped up.\n\nSuddenly, the images became three dimensional, solid, and seven heroes stood among them. A human in working battle plate. A dwarf with his battle-staff tipped with an hourglass. An orc with a huge battleaxe casually resting on her shoulder. A polder with twin rapiers in his hands. A tall willowy high elf with night-black skin and golden hair. An unarmed hakaan towering over everyone. And a dragon knight. Of all the motley band, it was the dragon knight who caused the people of the town to gasp. Even at a distance, even with the war dogs between them, they recognized the device of Good King Omund on the knight's shield.\n\nThe war dogs scrambled. For a moment, it seemed they might flee at this sudden intrusion, but the taxiarch bellowed \"Hold fast!\" and they held their ground, uncertainty over the unknown threat of a band of heroes battling in each of them against the certain fear of their commander.\n\nThe hakaan looked around and saw a clump of villagers watching the scene from a distance, gathered around what looked like some stables. He waved. \"Hello!\" he said, smiling.\n\nOne of the villagers waved back before being shushed.\n\nJohn looked at the taxiarch and immediately read the situation. It was a clear enough picture.\n\nThere was something about the war dogs. They loved Ajax's cruelty—reveled in it. John had crossed swords with other commanders in Ajax's army before. Ground Commander Vordokov was a professional—could be reasoned with, but he was an orc.\n\nNot the war dogs—they were fanatics.\n\n\"What's this?\" the taxiarch called out with a hungry grin. \"Allies of the alien?\" He was projecting confidence. Trying to muster his wary soldiers.\n\n\"Allies of all those who suffer, and seek justice,\" the dwarf announced. Sir John ignored the war dog, tilted his head toward the alien. \"Embers?\"\n\n\"A kuran'zoi,\" the high elf said, and the alien held her head up with pride. \"A time raider from the upper worlds. What the truth is I cannot say, and no people are all one thing. But by reputation? They're intractable, ungovernable, they loathe authority, hate tyranny and are totally, utterly without fear.\"\n\nJohn watched the alien. They sneered their approval at Ember's summary. That was enough for Sir John, they could work out the details later. After everything they'd been through before, he trusted Embers explicitly.\n\nHe could see the shape of the next moments play out. All he had to do was take the initiative. If he was right, the whole thing would be over in seconds. There was no time to communicate. No time to plan, and everyone, everyone had to play their part.\n\nJohn knew what came next, but he wasn't an assassin. He had his own part to play. He took a step forward, away from his teammates, and noted the taxiarch didn't react. That spoke volumes. He locked eyes with his enemy.\n\n\"She goes free,\" John commanded, his voice steel, \"or you die here.\" He could feel the muscles tightening in his comrades, the whole company like a steel spring wound tight.\n\nLycaon cocked his head at Sir John and took a few foolish steps toward the tactician. He was just out of reach. But close enough.\n\n\"I see you are a man, like Ajax. Why do you lower yourself with these... creatures?\" The war dog taxiarch looked at the elf, giant, polder, dwarf, and dragon knight. \"Little more than slimy things crawled out of the sea? Join us. Join me. Join Ajax. It'll be nice for you...\"-his voice lowered almost to a whisper-\"... to be on the winning side for a change.\"\n\nSir John took a deep breath, his body language changed and that was enough. Several things then happened at once, so quickly no one would later be able to say who acted first.\n\nEmber's eyes flashed into a starfield. The time raider's chains dissolved into starspace and reappeared around Flight Captain Lyria pinning her arms to her side. She was giving the hawklord an excuse to sit this one out. Gods, John was glad she was with them.\n\nThe time raider's right upper hand shot out, as though she'd been waiting for the void mage to do exactly what she just did, and her meson blaster leapt out of the hands of the war dog who'd chained her. The pistol made of glass and bronze slammed into her hand and its tip flared with prismatic light.\n\nJohn felt his skin tighten as Dazar warded him, and from the sun's shadow cast by Taxiarch Lycaon the polder Jackson Bootblack emerged, a rapier in each hand, and no one saw him move from where he'd been a moment before.\n\nThe hakaan burst into action and sped past him like a blur.\n\nAt the same instant, a call—a horn. From directly behind John a blast of sound like a chord played by a dozen trumpets, and hope sang in his heart—the clarion call of the last Storm Knight!\n\nAt the sound, the orc dashed forward into a knot of war dog commandos, her axe already hewing about her.\n\nJohn hadn't hesitated, he'd already drawn his sword and falchion. \"All right, you patchwork son of a bitch.\" He charged Lycaon who fumbled with the shortsword on his belt.",

They know and enjoy their reputation among humans for snatching children who wander too far into the woods. Humans *should* fear the trees.\n\nThe wode elves' natural ability to mask their presence, called *glamor*, complements their guerilla style of fighting, letting them strike quickly from cover and then meld back into the underbrush. These traits also make the relatively few wode elves who dwell in cities naturally adept at urban warfare.",
    "lore": "\"I'm scared,\" Wenna said. \"We should go back.\" The forest felt as if it was closing in on them.\n\n\"We're not going back,\" Jeremy said. Normally, such a statement would be the end of the discussion, but they were alone and far from home.\n\n\"What if we're going in circles?\"\n\n\"Then we *keep* going in circles!\" Dade said from somewhere up ahead. \"Until we find the elves.\"\n\n\"The elves have found *you*!\" a clear, bright voice called out. The children froze. They scanned the wood, but there were no signs of the speaker.\n\nThen, only a few feet from them, a half-dozen figures melded out of the background, as if the trees and bushes and grass had been painted on them to perfectly match the wode. They wore light armor covered in leaves, moss, and vines, and they bristled with weapons.\n\nMeliora gasped. Credan frowned, and Wenna hushed her. Dade was ushered back toward them by two more wode elves, his bow in hand. The children huddled together, Credan's hand on the symbol of Saint Gryffyn around his neck, and Jeremy's hand on the hilt of his sword.\n\nThe elves were tall, taller than an adult human, but seemed always to crouch as soon as they stopped moving. Their eyes were unsettling, widely spaced and huge. But it was their ears, long and tall and twisting and set with great scoops to catch all sound, that marked them as elves of the wode.\n\n\"Admittedly, though, most terrans regret the experience.\" The voice they had heard called out again—from above. The children looked up and now saw a wode elf with long, furry, twisting ears and nut-brown skin smiling down at them. They wore a brightly colored outfit. The children watched the elf leap lightly from branch to lower branch until finally landing with a flourish on the forest floor before them.\n\n\"*Consort!*\" An elf before them spoke in Yllyric as he stood from his crouch and bowed. \"*We have been tracking these since they entered the wode.*\"\n\nMeliora, who understood the words, whispered to the others. \"They called that one 'consort!'\"\n\nLlyander smiled, looking from Meliora to the elf who had just addressed them with a *See? I told you!* look on their face.\n\nThe tall, swashbuckling elf bowed to the children. \"I am Llyander, the Lightning Strike, Consort to Queen Imyrr.\" They indicated the elf who had spoken. \"This is my cousin, Rhythylthin.\"\n\n\"How did you know we were here?\" Jeremy asked. Dade stood just behind him, with an arrow now nocked.\n\nThe one called Rhythylthin reached out while Dade was turned, looking at the queen's consort, and deftly plucked the arrow from the young man's bow.\n\n\"Nothing happens within the wode without our knowledge,\" the elf said. Dade spun on him and nocked another arrow. \"And approval,\" Rhythylthin added, clenching his fist and snapping the arrow in it.\n\n\"You come bearing a gift for our queen—the *Codex Dryadalis*.\" Llyander nodded at the heavy scroll Meliora carried. \"My cousin Rhythylthin here was sent to capture you and escort you to the Orchid Court. But I am the queen's consort, and have my own thoughts on the matter.\"\n\nThe elf smiled at the children. \"But have no fear,\" they said. Their Vaslorian was perfect, their voice a melody. \"You are safe... now.\" The pause before \"now\" spoke volumes.\n\n\"Are you a... a... boy or a girl?\" Wenna asked.\n\nLlyander smiled gaily. \"I am a song! I contain melodies and harmonies alike,\" they said. Wenna smiled.\n\nRhythylthin rolled his eyes. Llyander noticed this and winked at him. \"Fashions change. My cousin here wears the new trends.\" They gestured at the other wode elf's garb and masculine appearance. \"Me? I'm old fashioned.\" They gestured to their own outfit and appearance. \"*Grace* never goes out of style.\"\n\nLlyander turned to Rhythylthin and the rest of the wode elf band. \"Their gift goes to Lord Tear, methinks. I will escort them.\" Then, suddenly imperious, they added, \"You may go.\"\n\nIn spite of his previous skepticism toward the queen's consort, Rhythylthin straightened and bowed. As one, the elves turned and flowed into the wode. In only a few steps, they melded into the trees and undergrowth.\n\n\"How did they *do* that?\" Meliora demanded, spinning to confront their benefactor.\n\n\"Hmm? Do what?\" Llyander asked, looking after the elves, wondering what Meliora meant.\n\n\"Just... disappear like that!\"\n\nLlyander looked at the other children with a combination of wonder and annoyance. \"Do terran children not play hiding games?\"\n\n\"Well...\" Jeremy looked at Dade, who was no help. \"We do, but...\"\n\nLlyander made a theatrical, dismissive gesture with one arm. \"Well, it is the same thing, then. But for our people, it is a game we practice all our lives! We would be poor protectors of the wode if we could not conceal ourselves within it.\"\n\n\"But that was...\" Meliora was frustrated at the elf's seeming evasion. \"That was *magic*!\"\n\n\"You say? Well,\" Llyander mused, \"terrans are a part and apart, it is said. It is your blessing and your curse methinks. Perhaps someday you can explain it to me!\" The elf's eyes twinkled at Meliora's frustration.\n\nLlyander turned and marched off. \"Come!\" they called. The children ran to catch up.\n\n\"Where are we going?\" Wenna asked.\n\n\"I enjoy the favor of Lord Tear,\" Llyander said. \"We are old friends. With me as your guide, he will treat you well—likely bestow favor upon you! You should be in anticipation of great treasure.\" They smiled.\n\nThe elf stopped suddenly and spun toward them, serious but kindly. They pointed to each of the children in turn.\n\n\"I will instruct you on the proper etiquette, but remember this: Lord Tear will test us. Some tests for you and some for me. The high elves and the wode elves are but distant cousins. You will hear much that is polite, much that is flattering, but it is all another kind of glamor. It hides deep tensions, recently exacerbated by the treaty with Ajax.\"\n\nThe children nodded. The elf, satisfied, marched off and they followed.\n\nJeremy turned to Dade. \"I feel like we're in a dream,\" he whispered. \"You are!\" their escort called out. \"The wode is a dream! With a little luck, one you may soon wake safely from.\"",
