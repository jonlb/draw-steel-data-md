If the effect calls for the use of your Intuition score, you use your Presence score instead. If the effect uses your conduit level, use your censor level instead.\n\nAdditionally, whenever you take a respite, you can open a portal to rest in the presence of your deity and bring along any allies. When you do, you can ask your deity three questions, which the Director must answer honestly if your deity knows the answers (though they might answer cryptically or incompletely). When you finish your respite, you and your allies can appear at any location in the timescape where someone worships your deity.\n\nWhile you rest in their presence, your god might also give you priority targets to enact justice upon. You and your allies each have a double edge on power rolls made against such targets. If you attempt to open a portal to your deity again before you have defeated your priority targets, you suffer your god's wrath, as determined by the Director."

    "description": "##### Piety in Combat\n\nAt the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain piety equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 piety.\n\nAdditionally, you can gain more piety by praying to the gods—but beware! Doing so can easily draw their ire, as the gods hate to be annoyed. Before you roll to gain piety at the start of your turn, you can pray (no action required). If you do, your roll gains the following additional effects:\n\n- If the roll is a 1, you gain 1 additional piety but anger the gods! You take psychic damage equal to 1d6 + your level, which can't be reduced in any way.\n- If the roll is a 2, you gain 1 additional piety.\n- If the roll is a 3, you gain 2 additional piety and can activate a domain effect of your choice (see below).\n\nYou lose any remaining piety at the end of the encounter."

You can choose the size of either animal, and if both animal forms grant you the same benefit, you can choose whichever you prefer. You gain the highest speed between the two animal forms and have all types of movement from both forms.\n\nYou can only combine animal forms whose levels add up to 12 or less. For example, you can combine a shark (8th level) with a horse (4th level), but you can't combine a shark with a bear (5th level)."

For example, you might take the Martial Artist kit, which gives a melee weapon damage bonus of +2/+2/+2, and the Mountain kit, which gives a melee weapon damage bonus of +0/+0/+4. If you choose to use the Mountain kit's damage bonus, then the Battle Grace signature ability from the Martial Artist kit loses the +2/+2/+2 bonus from that kit, reducing its usual 5/8/11 damage for its tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3 outcomes to 3/6/9.

While you are present, each hero with you treats the Discover Lore project related to a war or battle as one category cheaper. This makes projects seeking common lore free, but such projects still require a respite activity to complete. (See Chapter 12: Downtime Projects for more information.)\n\nAdditionally, if you have 24 hours or more before a combat encounter or negotiation, and you have one or more clues or rumors regarding the encounter or negotiation, you can make a Reason test as a respite activity. The following test outcomes apply to a combat encounter:\n\n- **≤11:** The Director tells you the number of creatures in the encounter.\n- **12-16:** The Director tells you the number and level of the creatures in the encounter.\n- **17+:** The Director tells you the tier 2 outcome information, and when the encounter begins, all enemies are surprised.\n\nThe following test outcomes apply to a negotiation:\n\n- **≤11:** The Director gives you three motivations, one of which belongs to an NPC in the negotiation.\n- **12-16:** The Director gives you one motivation for an NPC in the negotiation.\n- **17+:** The Director tells you the tier 2 outcome information, and you and each of your allies gains an edge on tests made to influence NPCs during the negotiation.\n\nYou can make this test only once for any encounter or negotiation."

    "description": "#### Tactical Doctrine\n\nWarfare is as old as civilization—and perhaps even older. As battle became ever more complex, military leaders invented tactical doctrine, outlining how combatants should be structured, used, and deployed. Doctrine can be learned at war colleges passing on ancient martial traditions, or directly through blood and sweat on the battlefield. Whatever path brought you to your mastery of historically proven tactics, you choose a tactical doctrine from the following options, each of which grants you a skill. (*Quick Build:* Vanguard and the Intimidate skill.)\n\n- **Insurgent:** Doing your duty, playing fair, and dying honorably in battle is your opponent's job. You'll do whatever it takes to keep your allies alive. You gain a skill from the intrigue skill group.\n- **Mastermind:** You have an encyclopedic knowledge of warfare, viewing the battlefield as a game board and seeking victory by thinking steps ahead of your opponents. You gain a skill from the lore skill group.\n- **Vanguard:** You have learned the stratagems of ancient heroes, letting you lead from the front lines and seek victory through sheer force of will and personality. You gain a skill from the interpersonal skill group.\n\nYour tactical doctrine is your subclass, and your choice of doctrine determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels."

Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs drama, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a respite.\n\nWhen you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited drama on its effect, such as Artful Flourish, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of drama equal to your Victories.\n\n> **The Auteur Troubadour**\n>\n> Abilities like Guest Star, Missed Cue, and Twist at the End allow the auteur to rewrite bits of what happens in the battle by temporarily removing creatures from an encounter, bringing people back to life, or causing a new ally to appear. These abilities and features are no more powerful than any other, but they're narratively different from shooting rays of fire or swinging a sword.\n>\n> This is because, uniquely among all the subclasses in *Draw Steel*, the auteur knows that the combat encounter playing out at your table is really a story being told sometime later, probably in a tavern.\n>\n> When the auteur uses these abilities, they are changing that story. They rewrite stories to make them more dramatic in the telling. What *actually* happened is a matter of some debate. Even the people who were there don't agree on exactly what took place. How people *remember* it is what's important!\n>\n> This is pretty weird, but also very fun. If it's too weird for you or your table, you could always interpret those abilities as a kind of magic.

When you enter into a negotiation with a bonded NPC, their patience increases by 1 (to a maximum of 5). Additionally, the first time during a negotiation that you personally make an argument that would increase a bonded NPC's interest by 1, you instead increase their interest by 2 (to a maximum of 5).\n\nYou can have a number of bonds active equal to your level. When you form a bond with a new NPC that would exceed the limit, you must choose which of your active bonds to lose."

You can't be made frightened, and if you are prone, you can stand up as a free maneuver.\n\nAdditionally, whenever you spend a Recovery, you can forgo regaining Stamina to invoke the roar of an invisible applauding audience. You and each ally within 3 squares of you gains temporary Stamina equal to 10 + the number of active bonds from your Scene Partner feature + either your Victories or the number of players in your game (whichever is higher)."
